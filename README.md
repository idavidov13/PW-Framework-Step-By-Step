# PW-Framework-Step-By-Step
This repository contains Playwright Framework, developed Step-By-Step. Most of the time, junior Automation QA start with already build framework, which can cause misunderstanding how it is actually done. Every commit in the repo has the goal to implement and describe how the framework is developed from scratch.
